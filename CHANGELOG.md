# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Admin console: an **APIs** page to register the APIs (OAuth protected resources)
  that accept access tokens, with the scopes clients may request for each. Scopes
  are read from the database and reach the auth server within a minute, without a
  redeploy. An API can be restricted to its own scopes, or disabled.
  `OAUTH_API_SCOPES` and `OAUTH_API_AUDIENCES` keep working.

### Fixed

- Admin console: registering or editing an OAuth application showed "Request failed"
  instead of the reason. Better Auth 1.7 puts it in `error_description`, which is now
  shown (for example, a confidential client with an `http://localhost` redirect URI).
- Admin console: the redirect URI hint now says that confidential (web) clients need
  HTTPS everywhere, localhost included, and only public clients may use http on
  localhost.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed

- First deploy to an empty database: the build now registers the OAuth protected
  resources right after the migrations (`db:seed`). Before, parallel build workers
  and concurrent cold starts raced to insert them, and the losing insert failed with
  a duplicate-key error instead of being ignored.
- README screenshots no longer show the Next.js development badge.
- Account dashboard: "Connected applications" now lists every app the user has
  signed in to. It only listed consents, and first-party clients that skip the
  consent screen never create one, so they never appeared. Disconnecting an app
  removes the consent and revokes the user's tokens for it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- First public release: OAuth 2.1 / OpenID Connect provider and admin console,
  built on Better Auth 1.7.
