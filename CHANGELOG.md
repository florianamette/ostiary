# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Admin console: registering or editing an OAuth application showed "Request failed"
  instead of the reason. Better Auth 1.7 puts it in `error_description`, which is now
  shown (for example, a confidential client with an `http://localhost` redirect URI).
- Admin console: the redirect URI hint now says that confidential (web) clients need
  HTTPS everywhere, localhost included, and only public clients may use http on
  localhost.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed

- First deploy to an empty database: the build now registers the OAuth protected
  resources right after the migrations (`db:seed`). Before, parallel build workers
  and concurrent cold starts raced to insert them, and the losing insert failed with
  a duplicate-key error instead of being ignored.
- README screenshots no longer show the Next.js development badge.
- Account dashboard: "Connected applications" now lists every app the user has
  signed in to. It only listed consents, and first-party clients that skip the
  consent screen never create one, so they never appeared. Disconnecting an app
  removes the consent and revokes the user's tokens for it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- First public release: OAuth 2.1 / OpenID Connect provider and admin console,
  built on Better Auth 1.7.
